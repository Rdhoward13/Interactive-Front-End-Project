# Interactive-Front-End-Project-Fan Zone

## Description

For this project we had to build a website that used two sever-side web apis. To hit our acceptance criteria we decided to make a web application that would help soccer fans place wages on soccer games.
The two sever side web apis we used were a global sport api that contained data for soccer and numerous other sports, the second wep api focused only on soccer. 
This became a challenge for our group. We had too much data and we were not sure where to go from there. However, our group decided we should focus on a small section of the data that was provided for us by our web api.
By deciding to focus on a smaller section of the overall data we were able to focus on a certain team and the most watched soccer event. With that we were able to give our users an easy website that provides the information that our users would need quick access to when placing their wagers.  
After collecting our data we moved into formatting the website. Our goal when creating the website was to keep it simple while holding the users attention. To do this we collaborated with each-other to think of an attention grabbing website name. We came up with the name Fan Zone.
Next we worked on placing our data from our web apis into columns. This made our website more formatted instead of having our data all over the place that would make it difficult for the user to find.
After adding our last bit of CSS to make the page more attention grabbing to the user by adding images, we made the page responsive. During the creation of our website we knew most users would be using their phone to find this information, working with that knowledge we used media queries to allow our site to fit on smaller and larger screens.
During the making of our website as a group we have learned that when there are no current games there will be no data in game odds due to the season being over.
